# Natural Computation Project, a.a. 2022-2023

The aim of the project is to perform a binary classification of Alzheimer patients with explainable artificial intelligence in order to identify patients and healthy people. 
The idea is to choose an evolutionary algorithm to perform a classification task -the algorithm chosen is Grammatical Evolution.

# Dataset
The dataset chosen for the experiment is the publicly available Darwin dataset for the Alzheimer.
The Darwin (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting) dataset includes data from 174 participants taken from handwriting  samples from both patients and healthy controls. 
89 participants are classified as Patients and 85 as Healthy. Therefore, the dataset is quite balanced. It is composed of 451 features represented by numerical or categorical values. The patients belong to the class labelled with  0 while the heathy to the class labelled with 1.
Handwriting data were collected according to the acquisition protocol composed of 25 handwriting tasks.
